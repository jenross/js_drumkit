# JavaScript Drum Kit

## About

This is the first of 30 vanilla JS challenges in Wes Bos' #JavaScript30 series. When specific keys are pressed, different drum sounds play for a specified amount of time. The JavaScript logic includes an event listener on the window that will run a playSound function on each corresponding keydown. The class of each key is dynamically updated when playing and then dynamically removed with the removeTransition function.
